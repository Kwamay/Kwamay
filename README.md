### Hi there 👋, my name is Kwamay



**About me**: I am a problem solver at the core, with excellent communication and collaboration skills and capable of working in a team of different people from different cultures while being both formal and professionally informal. I am determined, focused and disciplined but of course I know when it's time to relax and have a beer with a friend! 🍻
